Sure! Here are the definitions for each topic covered in the videos:

### Video 1: Setting Up the EKS Cluster and Installing Essential Add-ons
- **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):**
  - A managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.
- **CoreDNS:**
  - A DNS server that provides DNS services within EKS Kubernetes clusters, allowing containers to discover and connect to other containers.
- **KubeProxy:**
  - A network proxy that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster, managing networking rules to allow communication between pods and services.
- **Amazon VPC CNI Plugin:**
  - A plugin that allows Kubernetes pods to have the same IP address inside the pod as they do on the VPC network, enabling native VPC networking.
- **EKS Pod Identity Agent:**
  - An add-on that allows Kubernetes service accounts to grant AWS IAM permissions to pods, enabling secure access to AWS resources.
- **Metrics Server:**
  - A cluster-wide aggregator of resource usage data, providing metrics for Kubernetes components like the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.

### Video 2: Creating a Node Group
- **Node Group:**
  - A group of EC2 instances within an EKS cluster that provides the compute resources for running Kubernetes workloads.

### Video 3: Deploying a Sample Application
- **Namespace:**
  - A Kubernetes object that provides a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users, allowing for resource isolation and management.
- **Nginx:**
  - A popular open-source web server and reverse proxy server used for serving web content and load balancing.

### Video 4: Setting Up Internal Communication
- **ClusterIP:**
  - A type of Kubernetes service that exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP, making it accessible only within the cluster.

### Video 5: Deploying an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
  - A load balancer that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses.
- **IAM Roles and Policies:**
  - AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies that define permissions for AWS resources and services.
- **OIDC Provider:**
  - An OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider that allows Kubernetes service accounts to assume IAM roles, enabling secure access to AWS resources.

### Video 6: Configuring Ingress Resources
- **Ingress Resource:**
  - A Kubernetes object that manages external access to services within a cluster, typically HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

### Video 7: Deploying a Game Sample Application
- **2048 Game Application:**
  - A simple, popular puzzle game where players combine numbered tiles to reach the number 2048.

### Video 8: Using One ALB for Multiple Services
- **Multiple Services with One ALB:**
  - Configuring a single Application Load Balancer to handle traffic for multiple services, optimizing resource usage and cost.
